LIMITATIONS
	
	1. For a given flow, defined as (src_ip, dst_ips), our implementation assumes only pcount session takes place.  This means that only a single set of measurements can take place at a time.
		-> This seems like a minor shortcoming because we can always count packet along switches corresponding to the flow
	
	2. Running an experiment is very manual.  It requires:
		(a) emulating the correct topology w/in Mininnet, with the desired link loss probability, and correct remote IP address of the controller 
		(b) starting the controller outside the VM 
		(c) making sure that the pingall() run w/in Mininet is successful across all hosts so the flow tables are properly setup
		(d) manually running the ping command to initiate the pcount session

	3. Requires that the flow tables between all hosts that will be used in a PCount session are setup
	
	4. Multicast trees are hard-coded.

HACKS

	1. Hard-code the multicast trees:
		- in _setup_mtree(), we should really use self.mcast_groups to determine which hosts are a part of the multicast group and tree
  		- need a function that computes which hosts are downstream from a given switch, rather than hard coding this  

	2. Rather than query the switches for their flow table state, I keep track of each switch's flow table at the controller.  This is clearly not scalable.
